# Full-Stack-Website
My first complete responsive full stack website


#STEPS:

Where i used HTML for logic, CSS for styling and JS with expressJS, NodeJS for handling it and at last i used MongoDB(No SQL) for Database
First we will create a login page
Then we will create "Home page" that will be visible to only those who are already signed in to it
Then there is Contact Us section "if someone is having any query they can fill that form"
It consiste of multiple pages like there is "About Us" section also, if anyone wants to know about us they can know from there.
(It is fully ressponsive website)
